<h1>Dave's Cool Blog</h1>
<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>My name is David, but my friends call me Dave. I am a guy whose dream is to help those around me and also do cool stuff, like creating cool web pages, making awesome music, and making games with experiences that have never been done before.</p>
<p>All of my projects can be found on GitHub. They are open-source, so if you want to download the source code for any of my projects, including this page, then knock yourself out!</p>
<p>But while you're here, get yourself a nice cup of hot chocolate, and I can tell you about some of the things I like.</p>
